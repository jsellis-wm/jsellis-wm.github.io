# COVID Shiny App
While on the pandemic quarantine, I started working on a web application using RStudio's `shiny` framework that would retrieve all COVID-19 related data from the Virginia Department of Health, organize it, and display it in an interactive dashboard. While the app isn't live on the web, you can view some of the progress I made in [this repo](https://github.com/joseph-ellis/va-covid).
